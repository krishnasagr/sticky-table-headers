StickyHeader Table is an extremely light weight jquery plugin (< 2k - uncompressed) which makes lengthy tables more readable by fixing their header when the user scrolls the table.


The aim of this plugin is to create a simple straight forward method to create sticky headers with your table. 
It will work on any elements scroll, not just on the window's scroll. You just need a line of code to do the magic.
